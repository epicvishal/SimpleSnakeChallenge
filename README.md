## Creating a Standalone Windows Application

Follow these steps to convert the Python game into an executable application for Windows:

### Step 1: Install Pygame
Open Command Prompt and install the Pygame library:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Step 2: Create the Executable
Use PyInstaller to convert the Python script into a `.exe` file:
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --hidden-import=pygame --icon=snake_icon.ico advanced_snake.py
```
- `--onefile`: Creates a single executable file.
- `--windowed`: Runs the application without displaying a command prompt.
- `--hidden-import=pygame`: Ensures Pygame is bundled correctly.
- `--icon=snake_icon.ico`: Adds a custom icon for the application.

### Step 3: Verify Installation
Check if Pygame is installed by running:
```bash
pip list | findstr "pygame"
```

## Common Fixes
### Issue: Pygame Not Found
- Ensure the Pygame library is installed.
- If using a virtual environment, activate it first.

### Issue: Multiple Python Versions
- Use `pip3` instead of `pip` if multiple Python versions are installed.

### Issue: Permission Denied
- Run Command Prompt as Administrator.

### Alternative Approach
To bundle Pygame directly into your EXE file for a standalone application:
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --hidden-import=pygame --add-data "venv/Lib/site-packages/pygame;pygame" --icon=snake_icon.ico advanced_snake.py
```
This ensures all Pygame dependencies are included in the executable.

### Locate the Executable
After running PyInstaller, you will find the compiled `.exe` file in the `dist` folder:
- Navigate to `dist`.
- Locate `advanced_snake.exe`.
- Run the file to play the game.
